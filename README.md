```
now I don't wanna jump the gun
or misunderstand anyone but
I think maybe you have been
feeling something lately
I know we got an understanding
you ain't my girl
I aint your man but
I think maybe you have been
feeling this thing changing
the feelings I got for you
couldn't dry it's the truth
but you want something new baby
we got a simple thing
but it's about to change
or will it stay the same maybe
no matter what the road
I passed a load
of love and lust
and not much trust
but are you saying
this cant be us
let me get this right
girl you want us to be
official make this
thing for real
you for real?
baby let me know
let me get this right
you want to make me the happiest
man in the world
is that what you did
your for real?
baby please be sure
let me get this right
I know I heard ya
but come again please
it's what I want
exactly what I need
are to believe that
we're both on the same page
threw away my black book
think I'm done with that look
you took long enough to
come into my life
are you feeling
what I feel girl
the feelings I got for you
couldn't dry it's the truth
but you want something new baby
we got a simple thing
but it's about to change
or will it stay the same maybe
no matter what the road
I passed a load
of love and lust
and not much trust
but are you saying
this could be us
let me get this right
girl you want us to be
official make this
thing for real
you for real?
baby let me know
let me get this right
you want to
make me the happiest
man in the world
is that what you did
your for real?
baby please be sure
let me get this right
<♪>
let me get this right
girl you want us to be
official make this
thing for real
you for real?
baby let me know
let me get this right
you want to
make me the happiest
man in the world
is that what you did
your for real?
baby please be sure
let me get this right
